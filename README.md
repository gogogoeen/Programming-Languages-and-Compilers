# Programming-Languages-and-Compilers
# using java to implement a compiler for vc language
## how to use
first download VC and jasmin-2.4 files to the directory you want to run the compiler.
### compile
go to directory you put VC and jasmin and run and compile the whole program.
```bash
javac -cp . VC/vc.java
```
you finish the compilation of the vc compiler.now go to the lang directory.
```bash
cd/VC/lang
```
All built-in functions for VC are in System.java so you also need to compile it
```bash
javac System.java
```
now you finish all the setup
### run the vc compiler
